12 weeks into the program, we were assigned to a team of 4. Together we utilized Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js (just to name a few) to develop  a meal planner web application where a user can view, add, or update recipes with ease. In the 'Build a Recipe' page, the user can search for ingredients to add to their recipe and the information/images are supplied by an API. Our Calendar contained a lot of functionality; by simply dragging and dropping selected recipes onto the calendar, users can plan out a full month's worth of meals accurately. With the option to select a date range, the application will display the necessary ingredients needed for that period. To further streamline the process, users can print or email the grocery list, and even download a VCS file that is compatible with Google Calendar.

In this project, I learned a lot about team dynamics and the importance of communication. Some of my team members were people I had never met before the project since they were from another class. We also had half of the team working remote, but we were still able to produce an awesome product. Throughout this process, I feel like I never stopped learning. We ran into a couple of roadblocks in the beginning because we were eager to get to coding, but once we took the time to thoroughly design out what we wanted the application to be, we were able to execute far more efficiently. I personally learned a ton about frontend including HTML, CSS, and Vue.js. As a result, in just 2 weeks, we were able to develop an app that had quite a few features, looked amazing, and is something that we all feel proud of.
